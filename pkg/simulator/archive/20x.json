Coordinating services are essential to system operation, performing tasks such as maintaining configuration state, ensuring service availability, and storing metadata. Raft is a consensus algorithm, and Apache Zookeeper is a centralized service for distributed synchronization and group services. This talk shares a generic example of stateful coordination service moving from Zookeeper to Raft.",
