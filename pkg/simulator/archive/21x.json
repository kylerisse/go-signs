Then how you can easily counter the confusion with sound, practical, and easy-to-understand concepts, exercises, and techniques to make the topic relatable. When you leave this session, you’ll have new tools that will help you share the powerful concepts of immutable software with others and maybe convince a few new folks along the way.",

Multiple model versions were created, with Model Version 6 achieving a 95% confidence level in identifying stop signs. The study observes lower confidence levels as susceptible to cyber attacks. This demonstrates the ability to recognize anomalies, providing insights into performance variations across datasets. The success of Model Version 6 highlights the potential of advanced computer vision models for autonomous vehicle safety.",
