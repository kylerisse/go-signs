    "Description": "Diversity and inclusion within open source is being approached the way software development was prior to the creation of open source. Most efforts, in spite of significant resources and financial investment, are very fragmented, not openly shared, only address part of the challenges, and are not collaborative with those outside of a single organization or very few partnerships. We have to approach this differently in order to yield different results. We must drive diversity and inclusion as an open source community, utilizing relevant data and building on existing research and initiatives.",

    "Description": "Inclusiveness is vital for strengthening the sense of belonging. Community recognition thus needs to be more inclusive so that all community members, regardless of their background, interests, and skillset feel appreciated. Traditional recognition in open source tends to emphasize contributions in project repositories (or code), and we often miss valuable contributions from non-developers. Ray will share his experience finding different contributions, community recognition examples (both good & bad), and feedback he received on community recognition programs over the years.",

The NetFlow family of protocols and their cloud equivalents play an important role in understanding how your workloads interact with the network, and how those interactions impact user experience. In this session we will dive into what flows are, how to interpret them to gain visibility, and how some real organizations have benefited from these insights by leveraging an entirely open-source monitoring stack.",

There’s less of a latency budget than you think. Measuring delays from network requests and browser operations are necessary but they do not tell the whole performance story.
